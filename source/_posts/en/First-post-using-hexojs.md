Oh great i made a progress for this late years i want to migrate from Jekyll to Hexo.
Yeah i got the temptation to learn typescript now, but only when forced with money.

### Why?

I just don't like ruby, and jekyll building process.
I got confused when to use `bundler` command or to use jekyll.
### Then why hexo

1. It bring me closer to go-lang. Which yet i don't know anything about it, exept somehow it's popular.
\
My old site still available [here](https://sukrosono.github.io), also a lovely [d3js demo](https://sukrosono.github.io/id/Statistik-dan-visualisasi-data.html) i made 5 years ago.
In my eyes hexo workflow seems more appealing. Later i want to create some code to add more simplification
When writing on digital era using site generator like hexo.
\
Even more, now it's seems more enjoyable to do layouting or templating as developer.
I can combine webpack, react etc to create a web-UI.
I have alot of idea, now the gate is open. Now i can truely focus on SASS instead of css.
A utility that will circle around:
- .md
- .js
- .html
- .coffee
- .scsss

### How?
~ Regarless the back end the browser will consume html.
For serveral years i just think that we have to know the server language, but as the nodejs popularity increase i know people use some tools like pug etc. A template engine to be simple. It might be the mediator to designer to design a website. Now i see the opportunity to develop tools, a tools that give an ease of when writing a website post.


## The else
  Instead on use SEO, i got overwhelm by the discussion with SEO pro and cons.
  Let's be practical here, i found helpful hexo plugin, named [hexo-covers](https://github.com/sergeyzwezdin/hexo-covers).

  The post instalation review is not yet done, it might on the future post. Did you even believe the are some [exceptional opening statement](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42092567/atom-force-tab-width-2) on stackoverflow?

  Oh God Bless us, bower is reborn, any statement that I read previously is wrong. Let's trust the cute bird by using them :).
Stay safe, we can kill covid19 together. :)
