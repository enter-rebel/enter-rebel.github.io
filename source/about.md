A person who admires software engineering and fall in love with the web.
Surely not web developer enthusiast, because my passion is on software engineering. Interest in testing and automation.

My experience with programming was started on 2012, as learner.
Not sure which year i got my first and paid project as coder.
The sure things is it use CodeIgniter and MySql on back-end.
Obviously it use javascript on the front-end.
I have done 2 big project with CI so far, i also once writing a wordpress plugin.

I also have basic usage on java in 2018, using a servlet.
Outside of programming, I am interested in art, designing.
